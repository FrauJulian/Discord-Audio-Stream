<p>This NPM package was created to make it easier to stream audio to Discord.</p>
<p>There is a security feature of discord that stops the stream of audio after some time. This problem can be solved by disconnecting the Discord channel every 1.5 hours for 2 seconds and then reconnecting the channel. (If you use this package!) I recommend using a database to store the data e.g. MySQL, SQLite, json file and other database types.</p>
<p>The package does not fix this error yet. However, it is currently being worked on!</p>

**This module is designed to work with [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) v14. This package doesn't support older versions!**
